## Methods
The data was preprocessed. Duplicates were removed, missing items were imputed using the median, creating a "missing" value for nulls counts, and inconsistencies were fixed. 
Exploratory Data Analysis was completed using histograms, box plots, and heatmaps. 
Linear and Decision Tree Models were used to analyse the data.

# Results
From the metric scores, we can see that the mean absolute Error for the Decision Tree is lower than the one from the linear model.
